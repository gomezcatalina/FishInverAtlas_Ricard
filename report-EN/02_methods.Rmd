# Methods
## Survey Description
The survey is conducted annually in July-August. It normally involves two separate two-week trips on board a trawl fishing vessel from the Canadian Coast Guard.

A number of changes in fishing gear type and vessels used occurred since the onset of sampling activities, described in details in Clark and Emberley (2011).

## Sampling Design
The summer survey covers divisions 4V, 4W and 4X of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) which includes the Scotian Shelf and the Bay of Fundy. The eastern limit of the survey is the Laurentian Channel and the western limit is the Fundian Channel (Figure 1).

The survey follows a stratified random design (Doubleday et Rivard, 1981; Lohr, 1999). The number of tows conducted in each stratum is approximately proportional to its surface area.

The basic sampling unit of the survey is a 30-minute fishing tow conducted at a speed of 3.5 knots. This yields a distance towed of 1.75 nautical miles.

After each tow the catch is sorted by species and weighed. Each fish caught is then measured, and further sampling of individual fish weight, maturity status and age are performed for diﬀerent length classes. When catches exceed 300 individuals, a random sub-sample is used to obtain the length and weight measurements.

## Taxonomic Levels

Fish species caught during the surveys are identified by trained scientific personnel and their scientific name is determined. An internal species code used in the relational database is reported for each species (Losier and Waite, 1989).

By its nature as a bottom trawl, the fishing gear used in the survey catches certain species better than others. To ensure that meaningful ecological information can be extracted from catch samples, we report the catch records for the subset of species that are caught reliably by the gear. To appear in this atlas, a species must have had a minimum of 10 observations over the duration of the survey activities. While both catch abundance and weight are recorded, the weight of species that appear at low abundances is often recorded as zero in the earlier parts of the survey when scales of appropriate precision were not available.

We divided the species caught into five categories based on 1) their taxonomic classification, 2) the number of recorded observations, and 3) their period of valid identification. Category ”L”, for ”long”, was assigned to species that have more than 1000 records since 1970 and have been consistently identified since the onset of the survey. Category ”S”, for ”short”, was assigned to invertebrate species that were consistently sampled only since 1999, as discussed in Tremblay et al. (2007)). Category ”I”, for ”intermediate”, was assigned to species that had been 1000 and 200 catch records. Rare and elusive species (those with less than 200 catch records over the duration of the survey) are also reported but to a lower level of analytical details (Category ”LR”, for ”long rare”, and category ”SR”, for ”short rare”).

The list of taxa covered in this document is presented in phylogenetic order (Nelson et al., 2004) in Table 4. To ensure concordance with authoritative taxonomic information, the AphiaID from the World Register of Marine Species is also provided in Table 4 (Appeltans et al., 2012).

## Analyses

The Oracle relational database where all data are stored was accessible from the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to extract the data from the production server and to create the data products used in all subsequent analyses. Catch records classified as ”valid” (i.e. a representative tow without damage to the net) are used in the current analyses. To make the available samples comparable, catch number and weight for each species was standardized for the distance towed.

All data processing and analyses were conducted using the R software (R Core Team, 2013) using packages RODBC (Ripley and Lapsley, 2012), PBSmapping (Schnute et al., 2012), spatstat (Baddeley and Turner, 2005), gstat (Pebesma, 2004), maptools (Lewin-Koh et al., 2012), rgeos (Bivand and Rundel, 2012), xtable (Dahl, 2012) and MASS (Venables and Ripley, 2002). Figures 1, 2 and 3 were produced using the Generic Mapping Tools (Wessel and Smith, 1991).

### Geographic distribution of catches

Spatial interpolation of catch biomass (kg/tow) or abundance (number/tow) was done using a weighting inversely proportional to the distance, using function ”idw” of the spatstat R package (Baddeley and Turner, 2005).

### Abundance and biomass indices

For each species, stratified random estimates of catch abundance and biomass (Smith, 1996) are computed for each year. Yearly estimates of the standard error were also computed.

### Distribution indices

For each Category L, I and S fish species, the minimum area required to account for 75% and 95% of the total biomass or abundance were computed (D75% and D95%). These measures of distributions were computed for each year by using the Lorenz curve of mean stratum-level catch estimates and the area of occupied strata, using methods described in Swain and Sinclair (1994) and Swain and Morin (1996).

### Length frequencies

The length frequency distribution of catch is tabulated for each seven-year period (1970-2009), and last ten-year period (2010-2020).

### Length-weight relationship and condition factor

The relationship between the weight and the length of fish was estimated using the following non-linear isometric relationship:

\begin{eqnarray*}\label{eqLengthWeight}
W = \alpha L ^\beta  
\\
\end{eqnarray*}

where W is the total weight (g), L is the length (cm), and, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the parameters to be estimated. 

Average fish condition (C) is computed as:

\begin{eqnarray*}\label{eqCondition}
C = \frac{W}{\alpha L ^\beta}  
\\
\end{eqnarray*}

### Depth, temperature and salinity distribution of catches

For each category L species, We followed the methods developed by Perry and Smith (1994) and generated cumulative frequency distributions of depth, temperature and salinity of survey catches.

### Density-dependent habitat selection

We follow the methods of Myers and Stokes (1989) to evaluate how fish abundance in each stratum varied with overall temporal fluctuations of population abundance.

For each category L species, we fitted a model of the relationship between stratum-level density and overall abundance (the yearly stratified random estimate of abundance, defined above). To properly use the observations of zero catch while accounting for the logarithmic distribution of catch abundance, we implemented the model as a generalised linear using a log link and a Poisson error distribution:

\begin{eqnarray*}\label{eqHabitat Selection}
Y_{h,i} = \alpha_{h} Y_{i}^{\beta_h}
\\
\end{eqnarray*}

where, $y_{h,i}$ is the average abundance of stratum $h$ in year $i$, and $\alpha_{h,i}$ and  $\beta_{h,i}$ are the fitted parameters. The estimated parameter $\beta_{h,i}$ is referred to as the "slope parameter" and indicates whether stratum-level density is positively ($\beta_{h,i} <= 0$), negatively ($\beta_{h,i} >= 0$) or negligibly ($\beta_{h,i} \approx 0$) related to population abundance.

To estimate the suitability of each stratum, the median abundance observed during the years that are in the top 25% of yearly estimates is used. We combine the slope parameter estimates from the above model with the median abundance to identify strata that have consistently high abundance and whose local density is weakly related to fluctuation in population abundance ($\beta_{h,i} \approx 0$). Preferred strata are identified for each category L species.
